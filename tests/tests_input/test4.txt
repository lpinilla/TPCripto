Words that come out of the depth and fullness of heart
Echo the infinite, just as a tiny flower expresses infinite beauty.
When love breathes life into words
What is expressed is not what is said, but what wants to be said.
Inside each of us there is a poet, there is poetry,
But because we live on the surface
These are never born.
Those who go deep awaken divine love
And this love fills their lives with music, beauty, peace and poetry.
Their very lives become music
And on this stage truth descends
